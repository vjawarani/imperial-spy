# imperial-spy
I wrote a few AWS Lambda functions so that an HTML tracking embed I inserted into my emails would also track total email opens. The embed then swaps the image to show the number of email opens, clarifying to the recipients that I was aware of both their frenetic email-opening and their avoidant lack of response. It was meant to elicit a fear response in its purpose of privacy advocacy, alerting the recipient to just how much data they are giving away.

I have the [total number of opens](https://varunjawarani.com/imperial-spy) on my website.
